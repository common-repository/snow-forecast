Add a widget for displaying altitude specific snow forecasts for ski resorts to your website.

== Description ==

[Pistepro.com](https://pistepro.com/) provides altitude specific weather forecast data to enable skiers to plan their day and their stay in a resort. Snow forecast data is valuable content for website owners, encouraging repeat visits and longer site engagement.
The Snow Forecast - Piste Pro widget enables website masters to display snow forecast data in metric or imperial units. Snowfall varies according to temperature and so our snow forecast plugin enables your website visitors to toggle the snow forecast for the piste Base, Mid, or Peak altitudes for each resort.
